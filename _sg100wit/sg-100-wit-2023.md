Themed “Empowering yourself, Inspiring Others”, the 2023 SG100WIT List celebrates 100 Women in Tech and 31 Girls in Tech for their achievements and inspiration within the industry and community.

Some of our honourees included researchers, business and community leaders, and content creators who played a variety of roles across a spectrum of sectors such as semiconductor, aeronautics, biotechnology and ICT. This edition signalled our society's growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by female leaders in the tech sector.
