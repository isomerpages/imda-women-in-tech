<p>The Cross-Polytechnic Girls in Tech (GIT) was formed by SGWIT and girls
studying Infocomm Technology courses in the five Polytechnics (Nanyang
Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic
and Temasek Polytechnic).
<br>
</p>
<p>The objective of the collaboration is to retain, foster, and deepen the
studentsâ€™ interest in a tech career. This is done through programmes such
as talks, workshops, competitions, and mentorship opportunities.</p>
<p>SGWIT supports collaboration with speakers, venues, and sponsorship.
