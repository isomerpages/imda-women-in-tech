<p>J.P.Morgan’s GenerationTech programme, which started seven years ago,
is a global initiative aimed at youths aged 14-18, to encourage positive
contributions to society by designing tech solutions that address the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The global flagship tech programme was birthed out of J.P.Morgan’s goal
to inspire young girls to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) from a young age.</p>
<p>The third and most recent edition of the programme occurred in 2023 where
it saw a tripling of the number of participants over the last two years
making it the largest one so far.
