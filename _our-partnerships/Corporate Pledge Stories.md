<p>The SGWIT Corporate Pledge, launched in 2021, has garnered significant
support from companies committed to fostering a conducive environment for
women tech professionals. This initiative aims to attract, retain, and
develop more women in the tech industry by providing strong support systems.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, we have compiled case studies to showcase how
companies are championing change and celebrating the impact of women in
the tech industry. Each story offers a unique perspective on how companies
are driving impactful change in the tech industry, from breaking barriers
to fostering a more inclusive and diverse tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>Join us in celebrating the impact of championing changes for women in
tech by exploring our Corporate Pledge Stories. Together, let's champion
change and create a more equitable and innovative future for all.</p>
