<p>In collaboration with IMDA, SG Women In Tech, She Loves Tech and partners
such as ANT International and Micron Foundation, Girl Loves Tech is a programme
that started in 2022 and is designed to inspire, encourage and develop
our girls to be the next generation of female tech leaders.</p>
<p>Girls Love Tech 2024 brought together over 300 girls aged 12-23 years
old and embarked on a journey into the world of tech, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The 12-16 year old girls learned about Generative AI, unleashed their
creativity by using technology to tackle real community issues, had engaging
discussions with a women in AI panel, practiced their public speaking and
elevator pitching skills and were inspired by a mother-daughter in tech.
<br>
<br>The 17-23 year old young women had an intensive bootcamp on entrepreneurship.
They met unicorn founders, game changers in the industry, and benefited
from practical advice on career growth, ideation, validation, business
models, product-market fit, value proposition and scaling beyond Singapore.
With the help of mentors and experts, these young innovators got into teams
and pitched their amazing ideas on stage in front of the judges.</p>
<p>Echoing Minister Josephine Teo's message to the girls: Technology knows
no boundaries and certainly gender should not be a boundary. There is so
much that we can all gain by staying curious and learning from one another.
And also with technology, keep exploring and experimenting!</p>
