The biennial WiEST Symposium celebrates successful female role models in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), connects with students with ecosystem peers in the industry, and provides a platform for young women to learn more about STEM careers. This year, we are honoured to have President Halimah Yacob as the Guest-of-Honour to grace the event.
