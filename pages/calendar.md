We live in an era of artificial intelligence and quantum computing. These technologies will transform our everyday life, our future. But who is creating these technologies, shaping the future?

To truly make technology serve all of us, not just narrow economic interests, but a variety of needs, sustainability and security, we need diverse voices, skills and views.

<h4><strong>Driving Digital Solutions in Manufacturing</strong></h4>
<img src="/images/calendar/10 Dec 2020 - Driving Digital Solutions.png">

Presented by SGInnovate, Singtel FutureNow Innovation Centre and Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC)
In conjunction with Deep Tech Summit

Advanced Manufacturing, or "Industry 4.0,” has been viewed as a key pillar for Singapore's growth. In Singapore, the manufacturing sector alone accounts for nearly a fifth of the country's GDP. At the Industry Transformation Asia Pacific (ITAP) event in October 2020, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has emphasised that Singapore can be “a more digital, more resilient advanced manufacturing base” for the world.  
  
While the move to a digital manufacturing environment might seem challenging, the adoption of digitalisation and automation of manufacturing processes are crucial in facing the global economic headwinds. As part of the digital transformation, various partnership platforms are now available in Singapore, such as the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and Singtel FutureNow Innovation Centre, which both drive private-public partnerships and help enterprises with their transformation journey. Manufacturers, researchers, startups and investors now have ease of access to establish collaborations, share resources and explore digital solutions which offer more innovation-based and high-value production. 
  
Join us at our event where industry experts share how digital solutions can be driven within the manufacturing industry, how corporates, startups, and researchers may work together to further adopt these solutions at scale.
