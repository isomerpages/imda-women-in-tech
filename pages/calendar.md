Presented by SGInnovate and French Chamber Singapore

As the world moves into the next era of the industrial revolution, technologies today are primarily guided by big data and adoption of interconnectivity across multiple industries and healthcare is no exception.

The focus of the health industry has evolved over the years. There was once a time when surgeries and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) were the talk of the town, followed by a time when payers and insurance companies were the target audience. Now, the world seems to have moved on to a new age where the key stakeholders are consumers themselves.

As technology continues to improve lives, people are now in control of their health, making personal healthcare options easily accessible through online platforms, with the latest gadgets and apps at their fingertips. Future innovation is now dictated by the kind of choices which consumers make in the adoption of Smart Health.

Discover the upcoming trends in Smart Health, where consumer-centric products such as wearables and other health monitoring equipment pave the way for increased collaborative efforts amongst both corporates and startups in changing the quality of life.
