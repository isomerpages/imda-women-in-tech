Ready to say, “Yes!” to the Largest Online Code Competition organised by @Shopee? 

After a strong inaugural run in 2020, we’re back with our second installment of Shopee Code League in 2021, happening from 6 - 20 March! 

To all students, undergraduates and working professionals across the region — it’s time to put your coding skills to the test and compete in a series of challenges.

Form a team of 2-4 members, and solve real world problems that cover data analytics, data science and algorithmic challenges, specially designed by the Shopee tech teams. In addition, sign up for our training workshops to level up your tech skills!

Mark your calendars and join us for the coding event of the year: [https://careers.shopee.com/codeleague/](https://careers.shopee.com/codeleague/){:target="_blank"}
