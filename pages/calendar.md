![1](/images/calendar/rejoining-the-IT-workforce_2160x1080px_v2.jpg)

Rejoining the IT workforce is a daunting task, especially with the constant innovation and updates in technologies. Despite their strong work experience and expertise before their career breaks, many parents re-entering the workforce frequently meet obstacles in finding jobs, juggling the work-life balance and diversifying and upgrading their skills.

Hear from our panel of leaders (at home and work) about their own experiences in re-entering the workforce, balancing family and work, ways to encourage companies to rehire and help support returnees and upgrading one's skills to be relevant to the workforce.

#EachforEqual — An equal world is an enabled world, and every individual be it male or female, can do their part to bring about gender equality within various global industries. More than just a women's issue, the need for equality plays a role in the nurturing of the economy as well, something which everyone regardless of gender, can benefit from.
