<h2>Girls in Tech Week</h2>

The Girls in Tech (GIT) Week is a 3-day virtual event organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), as part of the SG Women in Tech initiative. The event aims to attract and interest tertiary students pursuing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine) and infocomm media-related subjects from the 5 local polytechnics in Singapore to learn more about the dynamic tech sector and the diversity of career opportunities it offers, and be further inspired to pursue a career in tech.

During 11-13 October 2021, students can interact and learn from female leaders from 17 participating tech companies through a series of discussions and games.

This event welcomes all tertiary students who are keen to pursue a career in tech. To register for the event, do click on the individual links for the each day below.
