During the session, we can also share and discuss on how Israel and Singapore had made tremendous progress over the decades and how our needs and aspirations will continue to grow and become more diverse and how we can all strive to continue to do better in Cyber Security where we all can fulfil our dreams to be leaders in business and society.
