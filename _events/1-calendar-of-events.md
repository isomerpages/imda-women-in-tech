<h4><strong>The Reading Club</strong></h4>

Tech Reading Club is a new social initiative founded by Chua Hui Xiang (SG100 Women in Tech) to encourage more women to pursue STEM/ tech careers. In each 30-minute session, members learn about and discuss a book on science, tech or design. Through these sessions, we hope more people will be acquainted with the opportunities and challenges associated with science, tech, and design and perhaps discover their interests in these areas. 

The first virtual reading session will be held on 1 April 2021 (Thursday), 8.30pm-9pm SGT. Sign up here to find out more: [https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub](https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub){:target="_blank"}! 

This is also a call for beautiful souls who will be willing to share a good science/ tech/ design book they've read! If you're looking for ways to help empower women, Tech Reading Club needs your support!

So what will it take for women to thrive in the new world of work post-pandemic? Well, we don’t yet know the answer – and, in some respects, we don’t even know the right questions to ask.

That’s why we’ve put together business leaders, HR Practitioners, and political leaders for our special HTS IWD #choosetochallenge event, in the hope of tackling the biggest questions we should be asking as we move forward in a complex post-pandemic world.

In this webinar, we look at how the virus will continue to transform the workplace, how women will need to adopt new skills to survive, how we can effectively address existing inequalities in the workplace and push for greater sustainability and demand new ways to thrive in 2021 and beyond.

Date: Thursday 25 March 2021
Time: 11 AM - 12 PM (SGT)
