How can we build a more inclusive society with gender diversity, achieving equality between men and women? Let us understand the impact of gender roles on the status of women through the sharing of a female game designer lead and a volunteer in the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corp.

<strong>Date</strong>: 3rd July, Sat
