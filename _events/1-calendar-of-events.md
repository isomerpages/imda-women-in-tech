Ready to say, “Yes!” to the Largest Online Code Competition organised by @Shopee? 

After a strong inaugural run in 2020, we’re back with our second installment of Shopee Code League in 2021, happening from 6 - 20 March! 

To all students, undergraduates and working professionals across the region — it’s time to put your coding skills to the test and compete in a series of challenges.

Form a team of 2-4 members, and solve real world problems that cover data analytics, data science and algorithmic challenges, specially designed by the Shopee tech teams. In addition, sign up for our training workshops to level up your tech skills!

Mark your calendars and join us for the coding event of the year: [https://careers.shopee.com/codeleague/](https://careers.shopee.com/codeleague/){:target="_blank"}

<h4><strong>The Reading Club</strong></h4>

Tech Reading Club is a new social initiative founded by Chua Hui Xiang (SG100 Women in Tech) to encourage more women to pursue STEM/ tech careers. In each 30-minute session, members learn about and discuss a book on science, tech or design. Through these sessions, we hope more people will be acquainted with the opportunities and challenges associated with science, tech, and design and perhaps discover their interests in these areas. 

The first virtual reading session will be held on 1 April 2021 (Thursday), 8.30pm-9pm SGT. Sign up here to find out more: [https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub](https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub){:target="_blank"}! 

This is also a call for beautiful souls who will be willing to share a good science/ tech/ design book they've read! If you're looking for ways to help empower women, Tech Reading Club needs your support!
