<h4><strong>Tech Reading Club</strong></h4>

[<img src="/images/calendar/TRC_Launch.png">](https://lnkd.in/g-a9wJN)
Tech Reading Club is a new social initiative founded by Chua Hui Xiang (SG100 Women in Tech) to encourage more women to pursue STEM/ tech careers. In each 30-minute session, members learn about and discuss a book on science, tech or design. Through these sessions, we hope more people will be acquainted with the opportunities and challenges associated with science, tech, and design and perhaps discover their interests in these areas. 

The first virtual reading session will be held on 1 April 2021 (Thursday), 8.30pm-9pm SGT. Sign up here to find out more: [https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub](https://projectosyo.wixsite.com/techreadingclub){:target="_blank"}! 

This is also a call for beautiful souls who will be willing to share a good science/ tech/ design book they've read! If you're looking for ways to help empower women, Tech Reading Club needs your support!
