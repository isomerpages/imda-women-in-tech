<p>While it is important to understand how a company can support and promote
diversity, it is important first to understand why it is important.</p>
<p>For example, one key area is the world of artificial intelligence. When
developing biometric solutions or smart devices, a diverse data set is
needed to serve a diverse population of both men and women around the world.
In our AI solutions, we account for the different facial structures and
finger sizes of men and women, as well as skin colours and voices. We are
putting special attention on developing this diverse data set.</p>
<p>Another area where diversity is crucial is in reframing our understanding
of our customer market. In the volatile consumer PC market, gaming is one
bright area. What if we could access the growing market of female gamers?
For this reason, in Asia Pacific, this year we launched the “Legion of
Valkyries”, an online gaming tournament which aims to support women in
the gaming community.</p>
<p>In order to ensure we capture these opportunities, our own diversity within
the company must reflect the goals we set. One of the biggest moves our
company has made in its growth of diversity &amp;amp; inclusion in the
last five years is our commitment to transparency, and holding ourselves
accountable through the publication of our global Diversity and Inclusion
report.</p>
<p>Our reporting reveals that there is still a long way to go for Lenovo,
similar to much of the technology industry. Currently 18.5% of our executives
are women worldwide, and we have set a goal to have 20% women executives.</p>
<p>To improve these figures, we have established both global and local partnerships.
We formed a global partnership with Women’s Forum the Economy and Society,
which held its first Asia Pacific level activity in 2019, in Singapore,
with the participation of more than 30 female employees from Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lenovo established the Women’s Leadership Development Program
(WLDP) in 2014. This serves as a global corporate initiative for advancing
high-potential female directors into executive roles. Since its inception,
the program has promoted 33% of participants to executive roles and in
the past three years we saw a 30% increase of global female executive representation.</p>
<p>Female Lenovo leaders representing nearly every market in Asia Pacific
met in Singapore on September 20, 2019, for the establishment of Women
in Lenovo Leadership, or WILL, a programme that supports female employees
in the company. WILL is Lenovo’s longest standing employee resource group,
founded in 2007 and since expanded and flourished worldwide, now activated
in more than 40 countries. Three executive sponsors support WILL in Asia
Pacific and I am proud to be one of them.</p>
<p>Externally, our CSR programs also target diversity. In Australia, we have
signed a long-term partnership to support Code Like a Girl, an organization
that hopes to close the gender gap in technology. In India, we’ve established
the Lenovo/Motorola Skills Academy to provide access to training and a
better income for unemployed youth and women. We support three skill development
centers providing vocational training to differently abled youth, three
digital centers in Tier 2 and 3 cities in India. We are monitoring the
increase of reach in adolescent girls and women accessing digital literacy
through these centers. In Singapore we have a partnership with Singapore
Association of the Visually Impaired that helps subsidise the fees for
a government certification program in skills training thus enabling visually
impaired youth secure future employment.</p>
<p>Finally, what’s also important is to know that our efforts are appreciated
by employees and external stakeholders. In the FY 2019/20 annual Lenovo
Listens survey, 87 percent of employees reported that they believe Lenovo
fosters a community where individuals of any background can succeed, regardless
of race, gender or ethnicity, a four-point increase from the FY 2018/19
score. For the first time, Diversity Best Practice named Lenovo to its
2019 Inclusion Index.
<br>
<br>We are looking forward to improving all of these figures – because it’s
what’s best for our business.</p>
