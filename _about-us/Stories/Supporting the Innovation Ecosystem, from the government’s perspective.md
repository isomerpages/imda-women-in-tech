<p>Innotopia Podcast, an initiative by PayPal Innovation Lab, sits down with
leading Asia-based innovators, from serial entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley
to corporate executives in APAC, revealing their stories, and highlighting
the unique challenges and opportunities they’ve discovered in the Asia
market.</p>
<p>The third episode features Jane Lim, an Assistant Chief Executive at the
Infocomm Media Development Authority, a statutory board of the Singaporean
government. The episode was recorded during the first week of Singapore’s
lockdown period amid COVID-19. Jane shared about the government’s support
for SMEs and the wider business community during the island-wide “circuit
breaker” that was imposed to curb the virus’ spread.</p>
