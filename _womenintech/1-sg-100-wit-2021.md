In support of 2021 being the “Year of Celebrating SG Women”, SG Women In Tech, in partnership with Singapore Computer Society (SCS) & Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), will be running the SG100WIT this year again as a special edition.  This edition aims to honour another 100 role models who have contributed significantly to Singapore’s emerging tech landscape.

This year’s edition will focus on celebrating the multi-faceted roles that women play in influencing Singapore’s Business, Workplace and Community.  It will also be broadened to include two additional categories -  young rising stars who are still in school, who could be positive role models and inspiration to their peers, as well as Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), who are also an integral part of our local tech ecosystem.

The winners will be announced on 15 October 2021.
