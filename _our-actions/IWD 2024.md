<p>SGWIT IWD 2024: WITness Her Spark</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;Insert event KV from attachment&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGWIT’s inaugural celebration for International Women’s Day took place
on 8 March 2024. This event featured trailblazing female leaders, including
some of our SG100WIT honourees, who shared stories of how they navigate
and rise above in the tech sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendees WITnessed how talent, not gender, defines success from these
inspiring stories, networked with fellow peers, mentors, and leaders, and
connected beyond boundaries. It was indeed a great opportunity for all
to get together to forge a path for an inclusive digital future.&nbsp;</p>
