<p>The Corporate Pledge is a collaborative effort driven by companies committed
to building a more inclusive and equitable tech industry. Companies pledged
to create a conducive environment with a strong support system to attract,
retain, and develop more women in tech.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join the movement now! More than sixty companies have demonstrated their
dedication to fostering a thriving tech ecosystem for women.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Find out some of the actions our corporate pledge companies contributed
to their working environment for this impactful initiative:</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Equal Growth Opportunities -&nbsp;</strong>We invest in our team
members, providing women with&nbsp;equal opportunities from recruitment
to upskilling, networking and promotions at Attribute Data. We set aside
annual personal enrichment funds and time offs to utilize for conferences,
workshops and professional certifications so that everyone has a fair allocation
of resources for their growth.
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Work Arrangements -&nbsp;</strong>We offer flexible work
arrangements, such as remote work and flexible start and end times to make
it easier for women to balance their work and personal lives. We see great
potential in mothers coming back to the workforce and provide them with
the room to contribute to team success with more diversity of thought and
experiences.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growing Young Women Tech Talent Pool -&nbsp;</strong>We&nbsp;partner
with universities, polytechnics, and industry technology partners to promote
careers in tech to young women. Hosting and facilitating data skills workshops,
participating in career fairs, or offering internship and work-study opportunities
to help young talents gain industry experiences while they go through their
tertiary education.</p>

<br>BofA Women in Technology &amp; Operations (WIT&amp;O) is a line of business
advocacy group for Global Technology &amp; Operations. It actively promotes
an inclusive environment where all employees have an equal opportunity
to achieve personal success and contribute to the growth of our business.
WIT&amp;O has more than 7,000 members who provide a community of support
for each other. Members choose to participate in regional chapters or globally
through workgroups and global steering group programs.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Develop and retain female talent</strong> 
<br>
<br>BofA is committed to improve promotion, retention and pull through rates
for women at all levels by creating a more inclusive culture and by advocating
for changes to our people management processes. We have created opportunities
for our female talent to directly interact with our regional senior leadership
team. Through these interactions, participants can draw on the leaders’
experiences to help them navigate through some of the challenges they may
relate to.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Seed students’ interest in technology</strong> 
<br>
<br>BofA has successfully ran Code to Connect series across multiple years.
This is a series that is tailor made for technology penultimate and final
year students. Students are given a real bank use case technology problem
to solve that gives them a good insight to how we utilize technology within
the organization. Additionally, giving them a better understanding of what
the bank does. Each edition attracted well over 200 applicants. Our selection
process has helped to increase gender diversity in the participants in
each of the edition, well above the diversity seen in campus population.
BofA strives to make this a yearly event wherever possible and we look
to do so in 2022 as well.</p>
