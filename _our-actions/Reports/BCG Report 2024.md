<p>1. Technology is transforming economies and societies throughout Southeast
Asia, but the tech sector remains predominantly male. The Infocomm Media
Development Authority (IMDA) partnered Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on
a 2024 study to understand this disparity and identify potential solutions.</p>
<p>2. The study of around 4,000 individuals across the six Southeast Asian
countries found that the share of women in technology across Southeast
Asia ranges from 34% to 40%, reflecting moderate progress since 2020. With
40% of women in technology, Singapore remains at the forefront of promoting
gender diversity and inclusion in the tech industry within Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>3. Companies are taking greater strides to support women in tech, with
70% of respondents in tech companies saying that their company has initiatives
to improve the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women—an increase
of more than 20 percentage points over our 2020 survey (49%). Job satisfaction
levels among women who currently work in the sector are extremely high
at 83%, on par with that of their male counterparts in tech and higher
than the average for women in other industries.</p>
<p>4. Looking into the four key months of truth in a woman’s technology career,
the report recommended specific steps that companies, industry associations,
and governments can take to support women in tech. These include cultivating
an interest in technology among girls by weaving technology into all aspects
of their curriculum and partnering with technology companies and parents,
supporting women re-entering the workforce after a break, creating awareness
at the workplace to mitigate discrimination and bias, and modelling inclusive
practices and engaging active mentorship at senior leadership positions.</p>
<p>5. Dr Ong Chen Hui, Chairperson of IMDA’s SG Women in Tech (SGWIT) initiative,
said, "There has been a noticeable increase in the number of companies
in Singapore implementing programs aimed at supporting women in recruitment,
retention, and career advancement. We hope the report will serve as a useful
guide for industry associations to prioritise their recruiting and mentoring
programmes. Diversity and inclusivity in workplace environment is important
– it drives innovation and better performance when there diverse perspectives
comes together to solve problems. It is also something that many talents
in the market look for.”</p>
<p>6. Vaishali Rastogi, Global Leader of BCG’s Technology, Media, &amp; Telecommunications
Practice, said, “Women comprise 34-40% of Southeast Asia’s tech sector,
but this proportion is lower for those in technical roles (20-30%) and
even lower in senior leadership in these roles (8%). Enabling inclusivity
remains an imperative. Diverse viewpoints help the tech industry to push
boundaries on development, but also enable adoption. I have seen firsthand
how women bring perspectives that uncover blind spots and challenge biases.
We need to take a whole- of-ecosystem approach, with companies, industry
associations, governments, and individuals to truly foster an inclusive
&amp; innovative tech sector.”</p>
<p>7. As Singapore continues to lead the way in promoting gender diversity
and inclusion in the tech industry, the collective efforts of the community,
government, and organizations like SGWIT are essential in driving meaningful
change and ensuring a brighter future for women in tech.</p>
