<p>To provide more insights on the strategies that companies, governments,
schools and individuals can take to advance gender diversity, The Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) partnered with SGWIT and IMDA on a new study which
surveyed 1,650 women in tech in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The study found that the participation of women in tech in Southeast Asia
is slightly higher than global averages, and about 65% of respondents agreed
that the tech sector does better than other industries in offering programmes
specifically tailored to recruit, retain and promote women.
