<p>Announced on 18 Nov 2024 by the Minister for Digital Development and Information
Mrs Josephine Teo, Relaunch is an SG Women in Tech initiative that is dedicated
to supporting women who are re-entering the tech workforce in Singapore.</p>
<p>Together with NTUC Learning Hub as the anchor partner, the programme encourages
women to embark on the next journey in their career and helps them navigate
the steps to be re-employed. The programme gathers organisations in Singaporeâ€™s
tech ecosystem to support women by bridging their technology skills gap,
enhancing their employability, while fostering a strong and inclusive community
for women to thrive in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Through a blend of upskilling programs, mentorship opportunities, and
dedicated job placement support, the Relaunch programme will equip women
with the tools they need to succeed.</p>
<p>We welcome partners to strengthen our cause in cultivating a supportive,
inclusive, and fair environment for women. Together, we can build a vibrant
ecosystem that inspires women to confidently relaunch their careers in
technology.</p>
