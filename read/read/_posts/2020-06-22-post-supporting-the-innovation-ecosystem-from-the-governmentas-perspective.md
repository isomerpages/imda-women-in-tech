Innotopia Podcast, an initiative by PayPal Innovation Lab, sits down with leading Asia-based innovators, from serial entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to corporate executives in APAC, revealing their stories, and highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities they’ve discovered in the Asia market.

The third episode features Jane Lim, an Assistant Chief Executive at the  Infocomm Media Development Authority, a statutory board of the Singaporean government. The episode was recorded during the first week of Singapore’s lockdown period amid COVID-19. Jane shared about the government’s support for SMEs and the wider business community during the island-wide “circuit breaker” that was imposed to curb the virus’ spread.
